# `moulinet`: Large Language Model Game Engine

This repository contains a game engine that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate games. The engine provides a flexible and efficient framework for creating text-based or visual games by leveraging the power of LLMs.

## Features

- **LLM Integration:** The engine seamlessly integrates with Large Language Models, enabling natural language processing and generation for interactive storytelling, dialogue, and gameplay mechanics. By default, it uses the `Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3` model (mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3), but you can easily swap this with your preferred LLM.
- **Modular Design:** The engine is designed with a modular architecture, allowing developers to easily create and extend game systems, mechanics, and content.
- **Visual and Text-based Games:** Support for both text-based and visual games, including 2D tile-based games, is provided by the engine.
- **Dialogue and Storytelling:** It provides tools and frameworks for creating engaging narratives and interactive dialogues, leveraging the power of LLMs.
- **Game Loop and Event Handling:** A robust game loop and event handling system are provided by the engine, allowing for real-time or turn-based gameplay.
- **Asset Management:** It includes an asset management system for loading and managing game assets such as images, sounds, and data files.
- **Cross-Platform:** The engine is designed to work seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems, providing a broad reach for your games.

## Getting Started

To get started with the LLM Game Engine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JosefAlbers/moulinet.git
```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

Install the required dependencies by following the instructions in the `requirements.txt` file.

3. **Create Your Own Game:**

Utilize the engine's modular design and tools to create your own unique games. The engine provides a flexible framework that allows you to focus on your game's design, story, and mechanics.
